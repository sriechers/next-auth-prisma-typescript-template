# This is a template for implementing Authentication using Prisma and Next Auth, written in TypeScript

This Template already supports Google Auth with refresh tokens and e-mail magic link authentication.

Styling is done using TailwindCSS but you could also swap it out for plain CSS/SCSS or something similar.
